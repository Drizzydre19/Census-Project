# Census-Project
Every ten years, the United Kingdom undertakes a census of the population, with the most recent one having
been conducted in 2021. The purpose of such a census is to compare different people across the nation and to
provide the government with accurate statistics of the population to enable better planning, to develop policies,
and to allocate certain funding.

This project aims to provide the government with insights on the following:
(a) What should be built on an unoccupied plot of land that the local government wishes to
develop? 
(i) High-density housing. This should be built if the population is significantly expanding.
(ii) Low-density housing. This should be built if the population is “affluent” and there is
demand for large family housing.
(iii) Train station. There are potentially a lot of commuters in the town and building a train
station could take pressure off the roads. But how will you identify commuters?
(iv) Religious building. There is already one place of worship for Catholics in the town. Is
there demand for a second Church (if so, which denomination?), or for a different religious building?
(v) Emergency medical building. Not a full hospital, but a minor injuries centre. This should
be built if there are many injuries or future pregnancies likely in the population.
(vi) Something else?

(b) Which one of the following options should be invested in?
(i) Employment and training. If there is evidence for a lot of unemployment, we should re-
train people for new skills.
(ii) Old age care. If there is evidence for increasing numbers of retired people in future years,
the town will need to allocate more funding for end of life care.
(iii) Increase spending for schooling. If there is evidence of a growing population of school-
aged children (new births, or families moving in to the town), then schooling spend should increase.
(iv) General infrastructure. If the town is expanding, then services (waste collection; road
maintenance, etc.) will require more investment.
